# LinkedIn Connections

In a youtube video I listened to Prof Alexandre Cabral (IBMEC) saying "As important as knowing, are people knowing that you know". </br>
This is something that I always keep in mind. Therefore, I am working to increase my networking, and one of the best ways to do so is by improving my LinkedIn web page. </br>
There are two main actions for that, one is to increase my connections, the other is to post content on my page. </br>
I have been posting some [python scripts for asset allocation](https://github.com/Gabrielmastrangelo/Quantitative-Finance-with-Python), one of the topics that most interests me. </br>
But today's project aims to approach the two actions at the same time. We made a python script that makes a web scrapping in the Capilano University webpage (my University). </br>

**Steps for the Project**:
 . Writte a web scrapping with Python to get the email from the professors
 . Save them in a file
 . Share the Jupyter Notebook in my GitHub page
 . Writte an article in my LinkedIn page explain the project, with the link for the repository
 . Writte an email for my professors, talking about myself and my study interests, and sending them the links for my LinkedIn page and for the GitHub repository
